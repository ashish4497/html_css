      <h1>CSS Tools: Reset CSS</h1>
      <img class="image" src="./assets/media/image1.jpeg">
      <p>The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights,
        margins and font sizes of headings, and so on. The general reasoning behind this was discussed in a May 2007
        post, if you're interested. Reset styles quite often appear in CSS frameworks, and the original "meyerweb reset"
        found its way into Blueprint, among others.

      <p>The reset styles given here are intentionally very generic. There isn't any default color or background set for
        the body element, for example. I don't particularly recommend that you just use this in its unaltered state in
        your own projects. It should be tweaked, edited, extended, and otherwise tuned to match your specific reset
        baseline. Fill in your preferred colors for the page, links, and so on.The reset styles given here are

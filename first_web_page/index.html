    <h1>Opening the Box Model</h1>
    <article>
      <p>We’ve familiarized ourselves with HTML and CSS; we know what they look like and how to accomplish
        some of the basics. Now we’re going to go a bit deeper and look at exactly how elements are displayed
        on a page and how they are sized.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the process we’ll discuss what is known as the box model and how it works with HTML and CSS.
        We’re also going to look at
        a few new CSS properties and use some of the length values we covered in Lesson 3. Let’s begin.

    <h1>How Are Elements Displayed?</h1>
    <article>
      <p>Before jumping into the box model, it helps to understand how elements are displayed.
        In Lesson 2 we covered the difference between block-level and inline-level elements. To quickly recap,
        block-level elements occupy any available width, regardless of their content, and begin on a new line.
        Inline-level elements occupy only
        the width their content requires and line up on the same line, one after the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Block-level elements are generally used for larger pieces of content, such as headings and structural elements.
        Inline-level elements are generally used for smaller pieces of content, such as a few words selected to be bold
        or italicized.

    <h1>What Is the Box Model?</h1>
    <article>
      <p>Every element is a rectangular box, and there are several properties that determine the size of that box. The
        core of the box is defined by the width and height of an element, which may be determined by the display
        property, by the contents of the element, or by specified width and height properties. padding and then border
        expand the dimensions of the box outward from the element’s width and height. Lastly, any margin we have
        specified will follow the border.</p>

    <h1>Margin & Padding Declarations</h1>
    <article>
      <p>In CSS, there is more than one way to declare values for certain properties. We can use longhand, listing
        multiple properties and values one after the other, in which each value has its own property.
